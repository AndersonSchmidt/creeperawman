You can see an example of how the creeperawman project works here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x9m3ttlj_M

Made with Angular, Node.js, Express, howler.js, Bootstrap 4 and Socket.IO. Node server hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Client hosted on AWS S3. I had also purchased the domain 'creeperawman.io' and it was working perfectly with the SSL certificate. It's no longer working because my AWS credits have expired and I didn't renew the domain.
