You can check the meme that inspirated this project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90sqgexVelc">here.</a>

You can see an example of how the creeperawman project works in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x9m3ttlj_M">video.</a>

Made with Angular, Node.js, Express, howler.js, Bootstrap 4 and Socket.IO. Node server hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Client hosted on AWS S3. I had also purchased the domain 'creeperawman.io' and it was working perfectly with the SSL certificate. It's no longer working because my AWS credits have expired and I didn't renew the domain.
